because this was only trained on 1 season, the model effectively tries to predict team ELOs, where higher ELO teams perform better.
So, ELO averaged by team just tries to predict team performance.
Thus, players with high ELOs are essentially players that statistically align with the teams that performed well.
This is why Gary Ablett appears here despite coming from a club that finished poorly that season.
It is likely that the best teams had lots of uncontested posessions, contested posessions, and frees against, so those stats are overrepresented in the rating formula.
